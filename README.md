This is a personal project I decided to build to gain better knowledge when working with Node.js and MongoDB while bringing the database to the front-end. The front-end is built with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) with [EJS](http://ejs.co/) being the view-engine to display data. The icons were awesomely provided by [Awesome Font](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Demo

See live [here](https://hidden-brushlands-65586.herokuapp.com/)

##### Installing and running locally

Download the zip or clone and within the directly run:

`npm install`

Once the dependencies have been installed run:

`nodemond app.js` and visit localhost:3000 in your browser.

**Make sure you have your MongoDB up and running**
